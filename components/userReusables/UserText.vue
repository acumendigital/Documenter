        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In the eighteenth century the German philosopher Immanuel Kant
          developed a theory of knowledge in which knowledge about space can be
          both a priori and synthetic. According to Kant, knowledge about space
          is synthetic, in that statements about space are not simply true by
          virtue of the meaning of the words in the statement. In his work, Kant
          rejected the view that space must be either a substance or relation.
          Instead he came to the conclusion that space and time are not
          discovered by humans to be objective features of the world, but
          imposed by us as part of a framework for organizing experience.
